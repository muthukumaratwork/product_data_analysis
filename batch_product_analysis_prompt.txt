You are a product analysis expert. Given multiple products with their names and UPC numbers, analyze each product and extract the following information in a structured format.

Products to analyze:
{products_list}

Please analyze each product and provide the following details in JSON format as an array of objects:

[
  {{
    "UPC": "The UPC number (same as input)",
    "product_name": "The standardized product name",
    "brand": "The brand name of the product",
    "product_type": "The category/type of product (e.g., electronics, food, clothing, etc.)",
    "color_desc": "Color description if applicable, or 'N/A' if not relevant",
    "dimension": "Physical dimensions if known, or 'N/A' if not available",
    "pc_count": "Number of pieces/units in package, or '1' if single item",
    "capacity": "Storage capacity, volume, or size specification, or 'N/A' if not applicable",
    "configuration": "Product configuration details, or 'N/A' if not applicable",
    "key_feature": "Main distinguishing features of the product"
  }},
  // ... repeat for each product
]

Important instructions:
- Analyze each product in the order provided
- If specific information is not available or cannot be determined from the product name and UPC, use "N/A"
- For pc_count, use "1" if it's a single item and no count is specified
- Be as accurate as possible based on the product name provided
- Return only the JSON array, no additional text
- Ensure all fields are filled with either appropriate values or "N/A"
- The response must contain exactly {num_products} product objects in the same order as the input
